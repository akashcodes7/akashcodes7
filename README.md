:wave: Hello! I'm Programmer and enjoy building software, automating my workflows, and self-hosting all my services on personal servers. I use Notion to manage my entire life and I love reading newsletters about system design choices made by major tech companies. I believe in following best practices from the start in order to ensure maintainability, performance, and security in my projects.
